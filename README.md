# Minecraft Dungeons Random Build Generator

This is a python script that will create a random set of weapons, armour and artefacts for you to use in Minecraft Dungeons. I hope that this might make the game more entertaining for people who are getting bored with the game. This is my first time using GitHub so please be patient if the repository doesn't look the best.

## Installation

Download the randombuild.exe file from the "mcd-randombuild/dist/" folder.
